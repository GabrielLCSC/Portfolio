## How to visualize my project ?

If you want to download the files and run the project locally, click the green button "code" and press "download zip".
Unzip the folder and you'll be able to run the website by double-clicking on "index.html".

If you want to visualize the website online simply click the link in the "About" section.

## How I deployed my project online ?

I used Versel.com to deploy my website. To do so, you have to link your github account to vercel. Then versel will ask you what project do you want to deploy. Just select the right repository, follow the final steps and HERE YOU ARE ! Your project is finally online.

I added Checkly, an extension that you have to use for your website in order to track how well or not your website is deployed. It gives you a lot of informations about that.

You'll have access to it right after your next deployment, in "Deployment Status" > "Running checks" > "view on Checkly".
